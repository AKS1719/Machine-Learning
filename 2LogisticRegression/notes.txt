Logistic Regresssion :
    Logistic Regression is a techniques used for classification problems 

Classification types:

    1:
        will customer buy life insurance 
            - yes
            - no

        this example is called BINARY CLASSIFICATION as it has only two 
        categories of answer
    
    2:
        which party a person is going to vote?
            - Democratic
            - Republican
            - Independent
        this example is call MULTICLASS CLASSIFICATION as it has more than two categories of answer


STEP 1 : 
    plot a graph

STEP 2: 
    WE FIND A sigmoid or logit function 

    SIGMOID FUNCTION 

        sigmoid(z) = 1 / (1+ e^(-z))
        where the e = euler's number ~ 2.271828


        here in the sigmoid function 1 is getting divided by a number slightly greater than 1 which means the result will be in the range of [0,1]

        so from this we can conclude that 

        the sigmoid function coverts input into range 0 to 1


        so in linear regression we are finding the y using 

        y =  m*x +b so now we will pass the same line to the sigmoid function that is 

        y = sigmoid(m*x +b) = 1/(1+e^(-(m*x+b)))
