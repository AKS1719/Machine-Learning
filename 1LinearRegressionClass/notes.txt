it is better used in profit estimation or price calculation 

using the information provided we can find the price 


independent variable and dependent variables .....

    -> An INDEPENDENT variable whose value does not change by the effect of other variables and is used to manipulate the dependent variable.    it is often denoted as X.

    -> A DEPENDENT variable whose value changes when thee is any manipulation in the values of independent variables . it is often denoted as Y.

    Example:
        we need to calculate how much crop can be produced on raining 
        Here the rain is an independent variable since it cannot be controlled 
        but the production of crops is dependent on the rain 

Numerical and categorical data 

    suppose there is  a databse consisting of data , we want to divide data into the categorical and numerical data 
    
    NUMERICAL data is numbers like age,salary, height (containes range of information)
    CATERGORICAL data is description like color,dog's bread,gender (limited to very specifical items)

Machine learning algorithms

    -> Supervised --> well defined
    -> Unsupervised --> group of data not so well defined 
    -> Reinforcement --> only positive and negative feedback

        Regression and Classifiction

        --> Regression:
            -> Simple Linear Regression -> imagine a lots of data in a plot and we find a line passing from them which gives the graph
            -> Multiple Linear Regression -> multiple variables 
            -> Polynomial Linear Regresiion -> we can draw a curved line through the data 

        APPLICATIONS OF LINEAR REGRESSSION 
            -> Economic growth :
                    used to determine the economice growth of a country or a state in the coming quarter, can also be used to predict the GSP of a country 
            -> Product price :
                    Can be used to predict what would be the price of a product in the future 
            -> Housing Sales :
                    To estimate the number of houses a builder would sell and at what price in the coming months 
            -> Score predictions:
                    To predict the number of runs a player would score in the coming matches based on previous performance 


LINEAR REGRESSION :

    Theory :
        Linear Regression is a statistical model used to predict the relationship between independent and dependent variables by examining two factors 
            -> Which variables in particular are significant predictors of the outcome variables ? 
            -> How significant is the Regression line to make predictions with highes possible accuracy ? 


    Euclidean Geometry :
        The simplest form of a simple linear regressoin equation with one dependenet and one independent variable is represented by 

                    y = m*x + c;

                    m = (y2-y1)/(x2-x1)

                    y = dependenet variable
                    m = slope of the line 
                    x = independent variable 
                    c  = coefficient of the line 

    Intuition behind the regression line 
        
        Lets consider a sample dataset with 5 rows and find out how to draw the regression line 

                    mean 
        x 1 2 3 4 5   3
        y 2 4 5 4 5   4

        linear queation is represented 

        m = ((n* summision(x*y))- (summision(x)*summision(y)))/ ((n*summision(x^2)) - summision(x)^2) = 0.6

        c = ((summision(y)*summision(x^2))- (summision(x)*summision(x*y))) / ((n*summision(x^2))- summision(x)^2) = 2.2

        x is find by mean sqaure method etc...


Multiple Linear Regression :

    it has multiple variable with it so there would be multiple slopes the equations  for multiple linear regresson goes as follows 

            y = m1*x1 + m2*x2 + .... + mn*xn + c
