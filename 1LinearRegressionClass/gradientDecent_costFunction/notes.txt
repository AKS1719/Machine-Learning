In out classwork in school we learnt to calculate values of x and y using a given equation 

In machine learning we do the reverse process of finding the equation based on x and y 

GRADIENT DESCENT : is and algorithm that finds best fit line for given training data set efficiently

in GRADIENT DESCENT we assume some  value of  m and b and the by following the graph reaching the minimal point global minimum
