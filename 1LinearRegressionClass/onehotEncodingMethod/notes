when a data set contains string type column there occurs a problem for machine to understand it 
as the machines only now the numerical data for triaing the model

these variables are called as categorical variables 

categorical VARIABLES : ARE OF TWO TYPES :
    nominal : does't have any numerical order in them 
        eg: color of object, gender etc
    ordinal : where the categories have some sort of numerical order
        eg: graduate < masters < phd

APPROACH 1: 
    to solve this issue we can assign each string a certain integer value 

    but the machine could misinterpret as values and start to think a string assigned number is somthing related to it's order it weight or it' importance


APPROACH 2:
    we create columns for each string and mark their values 1 in the row where they are present and mark the rest rows as 0 
    eg 
        town                monroe      westwinder      robbinsvilee

        monroe              1           0               0
        monroe              1           0               0
        monroe              1           0               0
        westwinder          0           1               0
        westwinder          0           1               0
        robbinsville        0           0               1
        robbinsvilee        0           0               1
